# You Speak Yoda

A front and backend application to translate english into Yoda's version which is mostly, back to front. Or in other words,[object–subject–verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93verb) word order.

It's built to show how to use the Doppler (Universal Secrets Manager) CLI to store and retrieve secrets and configuration stored in environment variables.

It's not (yet) built to be run in any other environment other than locally for development, but there are plans to change this to run in Docker, Kubernetes, Serveless, different cloud providers, etc.

## Requirements

- [Doppler CLI](https://github.com/DopplerHQ/cli)
- Python 3
- Node 13
- [Mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

If on macOS, you can install these by running:

```sh
brew install dopplerhq/cli/doppler python3 node mkcert
```

## Running the applications

Details coming soon. See the `README` in each application directory for now.
